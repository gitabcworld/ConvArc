## Acknowledgements
The initial idea of this paper was initially from [Attentive Recurrent Comparators](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.00767.pdf) paper.
Special thanks to Pranav Shyam and Sanyam Agarwal for their Theano and Pytorch implementation in which this work is based on. Additionally the ideas from [Deep Co-attention based Comparators For Relative Representation Learning in Person Re-identification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.11027.pdf) paper were adapted.
